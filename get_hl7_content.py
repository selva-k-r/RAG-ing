# HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide

## Overview
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a standard describing data formats and elements and an application programming interface (API) for exchanging electronic health records.

## Key Concepts

### Resources
FHIR is based on the concept of "Resources" - modular components that can be assembled into working systems. Key resources include:

- **Patient**: Demographics and administrative information about a person receiving health-related services
- **Observation**: Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient
- **Medication**: Information about a medication
- **Encounter**: An interaction between a patient and healthcare provider
- **Practitioner**: Information about a healthcare professional

### Data Types
FHIR defines several primitive data types:
- string: A sequence of Unicode characters
- boolean: true | false
- integer: A signed 32-bit integer
- decimal: Rational numbers with decimal representation
- uri: A Uniform Resource Identifier Reference
- date: A date, or partial date (YYYY, YYYY-MM, or YYYY-MM-DD)
- dateTime: A date, date-time or partial date/date-time

### RESTful API
FHIR uses RESTful principles for API interactions:
- GET: Read operations
- POST: Create operations  
- PUT: Update operations
- DELETE: Delete operations

## Implementation Guidelines

### Security Considerations
- OAuth 2.0 for authorization
- TLS encryption for data in transit
- Audit logging for access tracking
- Data validation and sanitization

### Interoperability
FHIR promotes interoperability through:
- Standardized resource definitions
- Common terminologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm)
- Conformance statements
- Implementation guides

## Clinical Decision Support
FHIR supports clinical decision support through:
- Clinical Quality Language (CQL)
- Decision support service modules
- Knowledge artifacts as FHIR resources
- Integration with clinical workflows
