# SQL Implementation Documentation v1.0

**Document Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Status:** ACTIVE - Production Implementation  
**Code Version:** 1.0  

## Overview
This document describes our customer analytics SQL query system implementation for the Q1 2024 deployment.

## Implementation Approach

### Query Structure
Our implementation uses a straightforward JOIN approach for customer analytics:

```sql
-- Customer Analytics Query - Version 1.0
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, 
       COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
       AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Tested with datasets** up to 500K records
- **Memory usage** approximately 4GB for standard aggregations
- **Query execution time** typically 15-30 seconds
- **Indexing strategy** focused on customer_id primary key

### Database Configuration
- **MySQL 5.7** database engine
- **Primary indexing** on customer_id 
- **Standard table structure** without partitioning
- **Connection pooling** configured for 10 concurrent connections

### Deployment Notes
- **Environment:** Production MySQL 5.7 cluster
- **Deployment date:** January 15, 2024
- **Performance testing:** Completed with standard load scenarios
- **Monitoring:** Basic slow query logging enabled
