# Archived Streamlit Implementation

This directory contains the original Streamlit-based UI implementation that has been replaced by the FastAPI web application.

## What's Archived

- `streamlit_app.py` - Complete Streamlit application with custom CSS and RAG integration
- `modules/ui_layer.py` - Original UI Layer module with Streamlit components

## Why Archived

The Streamlit implementation was replaced with FastAPI for the following reasons:

1. **100% UI Control**: FastAPI + pure HTML/CSS/JS provides complete control over styling and behavior
2. **Design Replication**: Exact replication of home.html mockup was not possible with Streamlit's framework limitations
3. **Performance**: Direct HTML rendering is faster than Streamlit's component system
4. **Flexibility**: No framework constraints on custom interactions and animations

## FastAPI Replacement

The current system uses:
- `web_app.py` - FastAPI backend with real RAG integration
- `index.html` - Pure HTML/CSS/JS frontend
- Dynamic result page generation styled like faq1.html

## Migration Notes

- All RAG functionality preserved in FastAPI implementation
- Audience toggle feature maintained
- Search results caching added for detailed views
- Real-time result overlays implemented

## Restoration

If you need to restore Streamlit functionality:
1. Move files back to their original locations
2. Update pyproject.toml to include streamlit dependency
3. Revert orchestrator.py changes to use run_streamlit_app()
